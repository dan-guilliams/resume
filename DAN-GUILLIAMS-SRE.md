## üë§ About Me
Dan was born and raised in Rochester, NY, in an Eastman Kodak household. From an early age, he worked in utility construction, starting at just 14 years old. Later, he attended college in Jacksonville, Florida, where he studied Architecture and Structural Engineering and quickly became one of the top CAD operators in the area.  

Returning to Rochester, Dan launched his career at Eastman Kodak while continuing his education at RIT. There, he transitioned into computer science and became a software developer, setting the stage for a rapid career ascent. His expertise soon brought him to the Research Triangle, where he spent the next 20 years developing software and advancing to the role of Enterprise Architect.  

In 2017, while working as an Architect at SAS Institute, Dan pivoted into DevOps with the Financial Sales Team. He earned his Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification and has since built his career around Kubernetes, DevOps, and Site Reliability Engineering.  

Beyond his professional accomplishments, Dan has been married to his high school sweetheart for 34 years. Together, they have three successful children and two wonderful grandchildren. Today, Dan and his wife live on a horse farm in Clayton, NC, where they enjoy the balance of family, work, and country life.
